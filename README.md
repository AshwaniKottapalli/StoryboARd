# StoryboARd
AR Project under Quark Open Source

**Introduction**

This project aims to allow users to experience various environments right in their backyard using Augmented Reality. With Story Board developer’s can present their creative side and tell different stories that our users get to experience. Now these stories can be interactive for example a murder mystery that you get to solve in your own house or an escape room. Or something more passive like an Augmented reality movie where you watch a story unfold while being a part of it. 
Developers will get to create their own rooms from scratch which will finally be compiled into a single app. The scope of this project is vast and can range from entertainment to educational purposes. 
For this project we will use :
Unity3D
Vuforia
Mixamo/Blender

With this project developers will get to learn about basic to intermediate AR applications using Unity Game Engine and Vuforia. 




**End Product:**
 The aim of this Open Sourced Project is to create a final release ready AR Application for the StoryboARd concept and publish its first stable release. The work required for the final end product :

Beautiful 2D UI Login Screen (Backend Concepts)
2D Screen for selecting rooms (UI Design Concepts)
Room for kids (TeamA : More work on animation,music and interactiveness)
Room for teens ( TeamB : More work on Gameplay and story and logics)
Room for All (TeamC : Working on stuff like audio and other unique AR Inputs)



The app will start with a login screen where as soon as a user logins, he/she can buy AR Rooms. Once an AR Room is unlocked, the user can open the scene, where he/she has to tap on the plane detected to load the AR Room in his/her surroundings. Now the user can roam around, interact with ar stuff and learn and enjoy in the virtual room.
For example one ABCD room which will be placed inside your room where you can roam around, interact with characters,dance and sing and eventually learn the english alphabets.



**Timeline:**

Week 1:  Basics of building Augmented Reality Applications + Game Dev UI/UX 
(using UNITY 3D, Vuforia, Photoshop)

Week 2: Scene Setup and UI Prototyping  

Week 3: Completing the Scene Setup and converting it to AR using Vuforia

Week 4: Scene Completion and Firebase Login


BONUS: Working on REST API’s, Prototyping on Figma, C# Scripting, Different AR Input Methods
